GM this week expanded its recall of cars with switch issues by more than 8 million, but it did not indicate when it first learned of problems in cars including the 1997 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2000 Chevrolet Impala.

According to Cook, the businesses surveyed represent more than 90 percent of the Internet and digital media workers in New York.<\/p><p>Comparatively, last quarter&rsquo;s jobs index showed 4.8 percent in growth. Looking back at 2012, when the New York tech boom was slowing, the study showed four consecutive quarterly declines, starting with 6.2 percent in the first quarter and ending with 3.4 percent growth.<\/p><p><\/p><p>\"It appears that the digital media and Internet sectors in both Boston and New York are running on all cylinders right now,\" said John Barrett, the managing director at Cook who conducted the study.<\/p><p>Cook surveyed only pure-play Internet and digital media companies -- from goliaths like Google to up-and-comers like Rent the Runway -- with 10 or more employees. Nearly all companies were financed with venture capital.<\/p><p>The overwhelming majority of hiring is happening in the digital ad tech and consumer web sectors.

Here, Inc. columnists give you their suggestions for keeping your cool in business.<\/p><p>Rising heat and extreme rainfall, both related to climate change, will also make people emotionally heated and more likely to get into fights. At least, that's the takeaway from an <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/science\/la-sci-climate-change-conflict-20130802,0,3466600.story\">extensive new study<\/a> from U.C. Berkeley. Three respected researchers studied the historical correlation between extreme weather and interpersonal conflict. They claim that their results point to large increases in anger, violence and unrest likely to come over the next 50 years.<\/p><p>I suppose it's possible that, when people are uncomfortable with their physical environment, they are likely to show it in anger and frustration, especially when the cause is totally out of their control. If nothing else, the prospect of tumult is a great excuse to start making your office a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/KDChocolate\">happier place to work<\/a>. So ramp up the pleasantries and the air conditioner before conflicts occur. Make plans for more social activity where people can lighten up and laugh a little. That way you'll keep things cool and good-humored in any kind of weather.<\/p><p>And here's more cool-headed advice from my expert colleagues:<\/p><p>1. Plan Ahead<\/p><p><\/p><p>Anyone who's been in or near New York City for the past few months is familiar with the mood-altering effects of extreme heat interspersed with torrential rain. Be aware of this dynamic and address workplace conflicts early, before they escalate.

Here, Inc. columnists give you their suggestions for keeping your cool in business.<\/p><p>Rising heat and extreme rainfall, both related to climate change, will also make people emotionally heated and more likely to get into fights. At least, that's the takeaway from an <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/science\/la-sci-climate-change-conflict-20130802,0,3466600.story\">extensive new study<\/a> from U.C. Berkeley. Three respected researchers studied the historical correlation between extreme weather and interpersonal conflict. They claim that their results point to large increases in anger, violence and unrest likely to come over the next 50 years.<\/p><p>I suppose it's possible that, when people are uncomfortable with their physical environment, they are likely to show it in anger and frustration, especially when the cause is totally out of their control. If nothing else, the prospect of tumult is a great excuse to start making your office a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/KDChocolate\">happier place to work<\/a>. So ramp up the pleasantries and the air conditioner before conflicts occur. Make plans for more social activity where people can lighten up and laugh a little. That way you'll keep things cool and good-humored in any kind of weather.<\/p><p>And here's more cool-headed advice from my expert colleagues:<\/p><p>1. Plan Ahead<\/p><p><\/p><p>Anyone who's been in or near New York City for the past few months is familiar with the mood-altering effects of extreme heat interspersed with torrential rain.

The way AGOGO works is simple: you choose from one of several categories--be it finance, news, arts, food, or politics--and AGOGO serves up the most relevant, recent, and interesting audio files on the Web. It's all personalized so that the content you're most interested in is always queued up and ready to go whenever you open the app. <\/p><p>At the same time, it also integrates premium and paid music services like Spotify and Rdio, allowing you to toggle between news programs and music. AGOGO is also launching a dashboard for the Web--similar to Spotify or Pandora--that allows you to listen in from a desktop or laptop. Plus, everything syncs.<\/p><p>For Heilprin, building AGOGO was a somewhat natural progression from his previous business, Modern Feed, which launched as Clicker.com. That start-up--which was acquired by CBS--let users browse different Web TV shows, videos, and save other content into one single playlist. In that sense, both AGOGO and Clicker.com are based on a very similar concept: there's lots of good stuff out there on the Web, but finding it, saving it, and consuming it when you have some spare time can be tricky. <\/p><p>The Business Model<\/p><p>Since AGOGO doesn't create any of its own content, you might think publishers would be turned off by it. After all, it allows users to consume its media without ever having to interact with the publisher's own brand. But Heilprin insists that publishers have responded kindly to the app so far--especially because it doesn't actually interfere with their own revenue streams. <\/p><p>\"We started out really early showing the prototype to publishers,\" Heilprin says. \"The response was uniform. It gets people to their programming. We don't touch their advertising. Publishers loved it.\"<\/p><p>In the short-term, AGOGO won't be generating any revenue--the app is free and there are no ads beyond any ads included in a publisher's original broadcast. But once the app has hit a certain level of scale and attracted enough users, Heilprin believes the service would be an attractive vehicle for brands and advertisers interested in hyper-targeted ads. After all, you could probably tell a lot about a person based on which programs they choose to listen to. <\/p><p>The Goal<\/p><p>Ultimately, Heilprin believes AGOGO can one day supplant satellite radio as the premier destination for all-things-audio. <\/p><p>\"Twenty-five million people pay for satellite radio,\" says. \"The market is tremendous.

The headline-grabbing case, three months ago, was the sale of Bloodhound Technologies. The five members of the founding team, all of whom had left the company in 2000, received a total of $36,000 on a $82.5 million sale. One founder actually received a check for $99.  Most venture-backed exits don&rsquo;t receive that amount of attention, yet there&rsquo;s suspicion that many are similarly disadvantageous to founders. After years as founders, angel investors, venture capitalists, and even participants in shareholder lawsuits, my partner and I can say with certainty that the time to address so-called founder economics--that&rsquo;s how much you, the founder, are going to get when you leave your company--is when the first money is raised. Founder economics need to be addressed again at every subsequent round of funding. If you wait until the exit or liquidation is upon you, you&rsquo;ll have very little leverage. Re-negotiating the capital structure during each round of financing helps to avoid an ever-increasing stack of liquidation preferences, cumulative dividends and other preferred terms. And it enables the entrepreneurial team to benefit from the increase in shareholder value that they&rsquo;ve created. Yes, venture capital is governed by the golden rule: If you have the gold, you make the rules. But there are still plenty of opportunities for entrepreneurial teams to negotiate, protect and strengthen their stakes. The best situation is the one is which you and your team have clearly created economic value for your shareholders. Generally, this means you&rsquo;re raising money at a higher valuation than your last round (an &ldquo;up round&rdquo;) and that valuation is confirmed by qualified outside investors.  In this situation, you want your team to be moving forward on terms that are roughly equal to those of your existing investors.  To do that, you&rsquo;ve probably got to eliminate or water down many of the provisions of the preferred stock. One way to do this without sending your investors into a fit is called tapering. As your company hits various milestones - raises more money, reaches a particular valuation, or achieves operational or revenue goals - the features of the preferred stock are gradually and automatically phased out. This makes a potential renegotiation of deal terms easier for venture capitalists to accept. If you&rsquo;re in the unfortunate situation of raising a down round, you can expect that your stake, and those of the other shareholders, is going to be diluted dramatically. In this case, the company may very well be distressed, and looking for an acquirer. But you and your team may still have some leverage. The investors want the highest price for the company. You and your management team may not have much incentive to go after that higher price, because between dilution and any liquidation preferences, a higher price will barely affect you. So in many cases, the board of directors will agree to a carve-out of the sale proceeds (above an agreed-upon target amount) for the founding team or for senior management. They want the highest price for your company, and they may not be able to get it without you.","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/math-teacher-bucket_14082.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>By the time most entrepreneurs think about so-called founder economics, it's much too late.<\/p>Writing as The Deal Professor for The New York Times, Steven Davidoff has been examining the many cases in which a venture backed company is &ldquo;successfully&rdquo; sold, yet the entrepreneurs who built it receive very little.

Indulge.<\/p><p>One of my fondest childhood memories is from my first year in tee ball.<\/p><p>For those of you not familiar with it, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tee_Ball\">tee ball<\/a> is often the very first baseball league for young players. Instead of having a ball pitched to them, hitters stand and try to hit a ball that sits upon a tee.  Often, a player will swing ungracefully several times before making solid contact with the ball ... at which time <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zeqjKQL2vXk\">all hell breaks loose<\/a> as every member of the defensive team madly rushes to snare the ball in play. Imagine throwing a piece of meat into a cage with nine hungry feral cats.<\/p><p>While I remember very little from my time in tee ball, I remember one particular play quite vividly. It came in the middle of a game as I was playing somewhere in right field. A batter from the opposing team hit the ball from the tee, in the air, directly toward me. I vaguely remember seeing the ball being hit, and I am fairly certain I made no attempt to move in any direction. I simply held up my oversized glove, closed my eyes tight ... and caught the ball.<\/p><p>In tee ball, catching a fly ball is akin to parting the sea.<\/p><p>Of course, at the time, I could not have told you the implications of that catch or how improbable it was. What made the play memorable was the reaction of our coach, Coach Kelly. Coach Kelly charged out of the dugout, ran across the field toward me with arms outstretched and a huge smile, lifted me up in the air ... and hugged me.<\/p><p>At that moment, I knew exactly how important that catch was.<\/p><p>That play, and my entire first year in baseball, could have slipped away into the cloudy abyss of my childhood memories forever had it not been for that demonstration of enthusiasm by Coach Kelly.  From that moment on, I was hooked on the game of baseball.<\/p><p>Clearly, enthusiasm is valuable in more than organized sports. Business leaders can and should leverage enthusiasm to motivate teams and entire organizations to overcome challenges and reach improbable goals. Used improperly, however, enthusiasm can become a detriment.  Here are four tips to channel your inner Coach Kelly.<\/p><p>Be authentic. Fake enthusiasm stinks like a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zQNL8a10ymI\">politician's stump speech<\/a>, and your team will see right through your artificiality. Be true to the cause and to yourself. Of course, some individuals are simply not as excitable as others, but that is what makes demonstrations of enthusiasm so powerful and awesome. If you aren't particularly demonstrative, try giving in to the inclination to get excited about a project or task at work, and then sit back and watch how contagious it can be.<\/p><p>Be spontaneous. Your team will learn to tune out your enthusiasm if you run through the office high-fiving people every day.  Learn to keep your enthusiasm in check and know the best times to really let lose. Sometimes, a random \"attaboy\" or a morning donut run will be the spark that gets a team excited for the rest of the week.<\/p><p>Be unconventional. Enthusiasm is about making an impression. Learn to be enthusiastic in new ways. Throw an office party, organize a team-building event, bring a karaoke machine (and sing) for an impromptu staff meeting. Like many other things, enthusiasm is best in moderation, so do not get so carried away that you end up <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q1Qy0U5RpCc\">losing face in the process<\/a>.<\/p><p>Be unselfish  The focus of your enthusiasm should be on others. A good leader is great at impressing upon a team the importance of a task and making team members feel important and valuable. An enthusiastic leader is good at showing it.<\/p><p>I remember very little from my childhood. But Coach Kelly, sprinting from the dugout and hugging me in the outfield after that catch, still lingers in my psyche.  That single play got me so excited about the game of baseball that I played throughout my youth and accumulated an ungodly amount of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mlbcardvalue.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/darryl-strawberry-rookie-card.jpg\">collectable baseball cards<\/a> (arguably not a benefit).  While my inability to hit a curveball and the allure of college life eventually led to my \"retirement,\" I continued in the sport by coaching little league baseball myself.  In coaching, as in business, when I need to lead a team, I often look back at \"the catch\" for inspiration. And I channel the enthusiasm of my inner Coach Kelly.<\/p><p>Have a story about someone who inspired you personally or professional through their enthusiastic personality?  Please share below!<\/p>","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/Enthusiasm055-336x336_28658.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful motivational tools in a business leader's arsenal. Indulge.<\/p><p>One of my fondest childhood memories is from my first year in tee ball.<\/p><p>For those of you not familiar with it, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tee_Ball\">tee ball<\/a> is often the very first baseball league for young players. Instead of having a ball pitched to them, hitters stand and try to hit a ball that sits upon a tee.  Often, a player will swing ungracefully several times before making solid contact with the ball ... at which time <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zeqjKQL2vXk\">all hell breaks loose<\/a> as every member of the defensive team madly rushes to snare the ball in play. Imagine throwing a piece of meat into a cage with nine hungry feral cats.<\/p><p>While I remember very little from my time in tee ball, I remember one particular play quite vividly. It came in the middle of a game as I was playing somewhere in right field. A batter from the opposing team hit the ball from the tee, in the air, directly toward me. I vaguely remember seeing the ball being hit, and I am fairly certain I made no attempt to move in any direction. I simply held up my oversized glove, closed my eyes tight ... and caught the ball.<\/p><p>In tee ball, catching a fly ball is akin to parting the sea.<\/p><p>Of course, at the time, I could not have told you the implications of that catch or how improbable it was. What made the play memorable was the reaction of our coach, Coach Kelly. Coach Kelly charged out of the dugout, ran across the field toward me with arms outstretched and a huge smile, lifted me up in the air ... and hugged me.<\/p><p>At that moment, I knew exactly how important that catch was.<\/p><p>That play, and my entire first year in baseball, could have slipped away into the cloudy abyss of my childhood memories forever had it not been for that demonstration of enthusiasm by Coach Kelly.  From that moment on, I was hooked on the game of baseball.<\/p><p>Clearly, enthusiasm is valuable in more than organized sports. Business leaders can and should leverage enthusiasm to motivate teams and entire organizations to overcome challenges and reach improbable goals. Used improperly, however, enthusiasm can become a detriment.  Here are four tips to channel your inner Coach Kelly.<\/p><p>Be authentic. Fake enthusiasm stinks like a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zQNL8a10ymI\">politician's stump speech<\/a>, and your team will see right through your artificiality. Be true to the cause and to yourself. Of course, some individuals are simply not as excitable as others, but that is what makes demonstrations of enthusiasm so powerful and awesome. If you aren't particularly demonstrative, try giving in to the inclination to get excited about a project or task at work, and then sit back and watch how contagious it can be.<\/p><p>Be spontaneous. Your team will learn to tune out your enthusiasm if you run through the office high-fiving people every day.  Learn to keep your enthusiasm in check and know the best times to really let lose. Sometimes, a random \"attaboy\" or a morning donut run will be the spark that gets a team excited for the rest of the week.<\/p><p>Be unconventional. Enthusiasm is about making an impression. Learn to be enthusiastic in new ways. Throw an office party, organize a team-building event, bring a karaoke machine (and sing) for an impromptu staff meeting. Like many other things, enthusiasm is best in moderation, so do not get so carried away that you end up <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q1Qy0U5RpCc\">losing face in the process<\/a>.<\/p><p>Be unselfish  The focus of your enthusiasm should be on others. A good leader is great at impressing upon a team the importance of a task and making team members feel important and valuable. An enthusiastic leader is good at showing it.<\/p><p>I remember very little from my childhood. But Coach Kelly, sprinting from the dugout and hugging me in the outfield after that catch, still lingers in my psyche.  That single play got me so excited about the game of baseball that I played throughout my youth and accumulated an ungodly amount of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mlbcardvalue.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/darryl-strawberry-rookie-card.jpg\">collectable baseball cards<\/a> (arguably not a benefit).  While my inability to hit a curveball and the allure of college life eventually led to my \"retirement,\" I continued in the sport by coaching little league baseball myself.  In coaching, as in business, when I need to lead a team, I often look back at \"the catch\" for inspiration.

Sullivan replied, &ldquo;Start by avoiding the top five dumb mistakes I see way too often.&rdquo;  Whether you are just beginning your fundraising marathon or you are in the midst, use these five mistakes as your personal checklist.<\/p><p>Mistake #1: Your answer to a financial question is a blank stare<\/p><p>Understanding and living by the financials of business are not a nice-to-have, it&rsquo;s a must-have. If hearing this makes you want to run for the hills, don&rsquo;t worry. Sullivan truly believes that anyone can learn this stuff. Until you are financially fluent, meaning that you have sharpened your thinking, analysis and ability to articulate the numbers, have someone at your side to support the financial discussion. Remember, you are asking people to invest a lot of money. They have to feel confident that their bet has a shot of paying off.<\/p><p>Mistake #2: No prior thinking or articulation about your go-to-market strategy<\/p><p>While it&rsquo;s great that your product or service is wonderful and everyone needs it, you have to articulate how you are going to get your offering into the hands of customers. Sullivan says, &ldquo;Start with how your offering fits into the marketplace to set the stage for your go-to-market strategy.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t stop there. Have definitive metrics on-hand about your customer acquisition and top-line growth goals, and what channel strategies you will use to get there.  <\/p><p>Mistake #3: You're blinded by product love<\/p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Let me show you a demo&rsquo; is the marker that a CEO is in love with the product and not with the business of the business,&rdquo; says Sullivan. An investor is putting money into you and your business. Whereas a customer cares about how your product or service makes his or her life better, an investor is looking at you and deciding if YOU are the next big thing. Can you lead the company to outperform the competition in all aspects of the business? The product is only one part of that investment consideration.<\/p><p>Stupid Mistake #4: You packed everything including the kitchen sink into presentation, but you forgot about the packaging.<\/p><p>A &ldquo;lack of ability to package the product or service&rdquo; creates all sorts of red flags for an investor.  A great pitch includes a short description of your offering&rsquo;s unfair competitive advantage. &ldquo;Include your plans for hiring the team and describe the next steps to execute that will enable you to achieve revenue traction,&rdquo; says Sullivan.<\/p><p>Stupid Mistake #5: Your only assets are a team, a dream, a PowerPoint and a dog<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s your job to find the right investor for your business. Hone in on angels or VCs that are interested in your industry, your stage of development, and your geographic location. &ldquo;Often an entrepreneur approaches the wrong investor at a time that is far earlier than appropriate,&rdquo; says Sullivan. It&rsquo;s up to you, the CEO, to build the right team of investors and to bring the right technical and business leaders and team at the right time, keep a clear focus on the target market, perfect your business model, and constantly monitor your product pricing and revenue streams. Sullivan urges CEOs to &ldquo;find a great technical co-founder early in the process. Do not foot-fault on that choice.&rdquo;  <br \/><br \/>Sullivan believes that a great CEO &ldquo;knows what to do and how to do it.&rdquo; That always means that you don&rsquo;t go it alone.

For example, when AOL founder Steve Case was in charge of the company, he led it into what became a legendarily disastrous purchase of Time Warner. Here are some of the issues that come up when entrepreneurs dabble in takeover madness.<\/p><p>Company Culture Clashes<\/p><p>When you've started your own successful business, chances are that you have strong opinions as to what works and what doesn't. An established company also has strong opinions that have been baked into its culture over years, if not decades. And that can lead to problems.<\/p><p>The entrepreneur who buys the established business might decide what is necessary for growth or for the company to meet the new owner's needs. However, the established culture has enormous inertia. You can kick, scream, and hammer away, but chances are often good that you'll never be able to divert the train into the direction you want it to go.<\/p><p>It takes a lot of time and patience to rework an established culture. You may eventually be able to move it where you'd like it to go, but that will take many small corrections, not a handful of large ones. Bezos could have the perfect answer for the Post to ultimately regain the financial ground it has lost over the years, but it doesn't mean he knows how to make the company go where it should any more than previous managers have.<\/p><p>Misunderstanding the Business<\/p><p>It helps to thoroughly understand the type of business you're about to take over. Not to say that an outside view can't be helpful. Far from it. Companies have often gained great value from recruiting insight from another industry. When it was in a slump, IBM benefited greatly from recruiting Lou Gerstner after his experience at American Express and RJR Nabisco.<\/p><p>And yet, outside expertise can be a danger. Just ask Apple what happened when Pepsi executive John Sculley took control. It was ultimately an unqualified disaster until Steve Jobs returned. An executive must be able both to rely on sound principles of business and the ability to see the unique ways they must work in a given context. Gerstner had experience in vastly different industries and had developed that conceptual shift. An entrepreneur must remember that what seems to work at one company and in one context might not in a significantly different type of company, where sales models, customers, and other dynamics may be unfamiliar.<\/p><p>Speaking of Steve Jobs, when he took over at Pixar, he tried using a sales model he had developed for the hardware business at Apple and NeXT. Ultimately, though, Pixar wasn't successful until Jobs realized that its future was in developing movies, not in delivering tools to animators.<\/p><p>Radical Change Can Be Good--or Bad<\/p><p>Businesspeople like to put their personal stamps on what they do. Who can blame them? Doing an impersonation of someone else would seem a dull task. Entrepreneurs, being used to blazing a trail and doing things their way, can walk into a new situation and want to undertake a major renovation.<\/p><p>But it may be that the business doesn't need a big overhaul. It might be relatively strong and only require some redirection. Or it might be that without a new approach, the company will be doomed. Success in taking over an established company means being able to discern what it really needs and how to best deliver the required change.<\/p><p>Will Bezos do great things at the Washington Post? It's hardly a given. Perhaps the biggest thing he and other entrepreneurs can do is to take time to really see what is happening inside the company and then to develop a strategy that can take the business from where it currently is to where its potential lies.<\/p>","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/washington-post-building-2910x1350_28692.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Amazon's founder picked up the Washington Post for $250 million--almost pocket change for him.

I kind of figured I could always go back and be banker again and fortunately, I never, ever looked back.\"<\/p><p>Jimmy Wales, the creator of Wikipedia, didn't begin his career on Wall Street, but he was a financial professional. He started out at a future and options trading firm, Chicago Options Associates. Here's how Wikipedia describes his transition to entrepreneurship: \"Inspired by the remarkable initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through 'speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations,' he decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur.\" His first venture was a \"guy search portal\" full of female images, Bomis. He used money from Bomis to launch the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.<\/p><p>Dan Leahy worked for Silver Lake Partners then Brown Brothers Harriman. His friend Ben McKean worked for Merrill Lynch. The pair teamed up in 2009 and created restaurant discount finder Village Vines, which raised $4 million from investors like Salesforce's Mike Lazerow. It was renamed Savored and in 2012 sold to Groupon, where McKean is now a general manager.<\/p><p>Olga Vidisheva, CEO of Shoptiques; Andy Dunn, CEO of Bonobos; Rob Cromer, CEO of AdCade; James

The first step in building your business is creating a viable product that a customer is willing to buy.  Focus your marketing strategy, and by that we mean the 4 Ps--product, pricing, promotion, and place (distribution), on a single customer or small group of customers.  In your case, you may find a specific food market or restaurant that you can uniquely serve.  Or, you may find a specific product that you can produce better than food produced with traditional farming methods.<\/p><p>Once you have proven the business model with a few customers, you can think about new ways to promote your business.  This might be through \"push\" methods such as advertising, where you are trying to reach new potential customers with your message.  These methods may reach the largest number of potential customers, but you may be more effective with targeted \"pull\" methods aimed at specific customers.  The easiest \"pull\" approach is a referral from existing customers.  Can you ask your delighted customers to refer your business to their friends?  The beauty of emerging social media marketing is that it is based on these \"pull\" techniques, and can be both impactful and cost effective.<\/p><p>Once you've built a solid small business with a set of core customers, you can think about the next step in scaling your business, and the next set of trade-offs.

pursuit of much more--and less--than a quick return on investment.<\/p><p>As they scrambled yesterday to explain why Jeff Bezos would buy The Washington Post for $250 million, journalists&rsquo; first reactions were hopeful. This almost never happens with journalists. New York Times reporter Christine Haughney quoted Alan Mutter, a consultant who writes the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur, who regards the deal as the best thing that could have happened to the Post, if not the entire news industry. The purchase, he writes, &ldquo;finally puts a true digital native at the helm of a newspaper company.&rdquo; Over at Time.com, Roona Faroohar chimed in that Bezos was not &ldquo;just another rich guy buying a newspaper.&rdquo; Instead, she pointed out, he is &ldquo;one of the visionary technology business leaders of our age.&rdquo;<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why journalists should invest such hope in Bezos. The man who created e-commerce is a creative juggernaut who rolls from one business victory to another. Any journalist--this writer included--would love to have him wave a digital wand over print publishing and return the industry to the monopoly profits the printing press once conferred.<\/p><p>But let&rsquo;s face it: There is no such wand. Other entrepreneurs from outside publishing have bought legendary news organizations, and the results so far have been less than transformational. Michael Bloomberg and the Canadian Thomson family, both of whom built fortunes in financial data, bought BusinessWeek and Reuters, respectively. Audio hardware entrepreneur Sidney Harmon bought Newsweek (from the Washington Post, in fact), and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes bought The New Republic. In most cases the influx of cash and energy made for better and more digitally savvy publications. But news remains a tough, tough business. Professional news gathering of the kind the Post practices is expensive, and it is getting increasingly tough to convince either advertisers or readers to cover the costs.<\/p><p>Bezos is certainly aware of those headwinds--he himself noted the consumer resistance to paying for news in an interview. And while many commentators noted that $250 million is only 1% of Bezos&rsquo; estimated net worth--well, $250 million buys you a lot of social media startups with much more promising growth outlooks. It&rsquo;s probably no accident that Bezos bought the paper under his own aegis, thus avoiding having to convince his board or Wall Street that buying an old-media property that lost $53 million last year would be a good deal for Amazon&rsquo;s shareholders.<\/p><p>So, presumably Bezos has something other than a quick return on investment in mind. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly the impression you get from reading his letter to the Post&rsquo;s employees and the terms of the deal. &ldquo;Journalism plays a critical role in a free society, and The Washington Post--as the hometown paper of the capital city of the United States--is especially important,&rdquo; his letter read. &ldquo;The values of The Post do not need changing. The paper's duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.&rdquo; Those are not indications of a man bent on tearing the old system out by its roots. Nor are the terms in the deal&rsquo;s term sheet, which guarantee Post employees their current salaries, benefits and employment for at least a year.<\/p><p>So what does Jeff want? I asked Barry Schuler, the former CEO of the entity once known as AOL Time Warner--and as such, a man who knows something about mergers between tech entrepreneurs and old media. Schuler pointed out that for a very reasonable price--&ldquo;Less than a quarter of what Yahoo paid for Tumblr, which is crazy&rdquo;--Bezos owns one of the most respected and influential voices in the most powerful city on earth. Media has an appeal that has lured many non-media moguls over the years--not just the current crop of rich guys from Silicon Valley but also, historically, the chemical baron Eugene Meyer, patriarch of the family that sold the Post to Bezos.<\/p><p>Bezos, then, fits into a tradition. Prime media properties have a way of finding their way into the possession of successful entrepreneurs--as do yachts, trophy companies, and Caribbean islands. And no one can deny that entrepreneurs such as Bezos have earned the privilege. We in journalism hope that the &ldquo;rich guys&rdquo; buying media properties regard their purchases as more of a public trust than, say, they might regard a nice yacht. At least for now, the 49-year old Bezos seems to justify that hope. For anyone who cares about serious journalism, that&rsquo;s way better than a digital wand.<\/p>","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/bezos-1940x900_28680.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>With his purchase of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos is in pursuit of much more--and less--than a quick return on investment.<\/p><p>As they scrambled yesterday to explain why Jeff Bezos would buy The Washington Post for $250 million, journalists&rsquo; first reactions were hopeful.

But too many entrepreneurs get trapped in their own heads.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">If you run a start-up--whether it&rsquo;s for profit or a social enterprise--one of the big questions that you face very day is whether to spend more time thinking about your venture&rsquo;s problems or just make a decision and take action.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;ve been through an educational process that puts a tremendous emphasis on getting you to think hard before acting and record your thinking in exhaustive detail.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">Many of America&rsquo;s greatest entrepreneurs, from Bill Gates to Jeff Bezos, have been through that kind of cerebrally-intensive education at Harvard and Princeton, respectively. To be sure, both institutions have evolved more to encourage their students to get real-world experience than they did when Gates and Bezos were attending them.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">But over-thinking a problem can be disastrous for a start-up. In technology-based start-ups, engineers left to their own devices will keep refining their product to impress other engineers and never think it is ready to be put in front of a customer. That&rsquo;s why such start-ups usually burn through their investors&rsquo; money before getting any revenues.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">As a teacher of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College--U.S. News & World Report has ranked its undergraduate entrepreneurship program tops in the U.S. every year for the last 20--I have concluded that aspiring entrepreneurs must know when to stop thinking and start acting.<\/p>So, You're Ready to Take Action<p class=\"Normal\">How to teach them this became a real problem for me this spring when Babson asked me to create a new course to be called Foundations of Entrepreneurial Management (FEM).<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">FEM is based on one of Babson&rsquo;s best ideas: that aspiring business leaders should both think and act entrepreneurially. And in my mind, Babson&rsquo;s approach, dubbed Entrepreneurial Thought & Action (ET&A), emphasizes the importance of both thinking and doing, as described in 2011&rsquo;s The New Entrepreneurial Leader co-authored by Danna Greenberg, Kate McKone-Sweet and H. James Wilson.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">In a sense, ET&A springs from the motto of MIT, the alma mater of the college founder, Roger Babson. MIT&rsquo;s seal includes the Latin words--mens et manus--which translates as Mind and Hand. I interpret MIT&rsquo;s philosophy to be that students should analyze a problem, think of a solution, build and test a prototype, see how well it solves the problem, learn from the experiment, and apply that learning to the next iteration of the prototype.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">What does this mean for you as an entrepreneur? <\/p><p class=\"Normal\">You should build your company by pairing up two logics -- creative -- where you come up with a business idea, try it, and see what happens; and predictive -- set a long-term goal and develop a clear progression of steps to achieve the goal.<\/p>How It Works<p class=\"Normal\">For example, if you were engaged in resource planning for your venture, the predictive mindset would make you ask yourself: &ldquo;How much capital do we need? Who do we know? and How do we pitch to get them interested?&rdquo; whereas the creative one would lead you to say &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the means at hand, What do we have? Who do we know? and \"How can we make something happen with what we&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">An important ET&A theme is that these two ways of thinking about entrepreneurship co-exist. If your goal is to create economic and social value, you can apply ET&A to a variety of business situations you might encounter during your career, including:<\/p><p class=\"List_0020Paragraph\">&middot;     Starting and leading a new for-profit, non-profit or social venture;<\/p><p class=\"List_0020Paragraph\">&middot;     Joining the team of a growing enterprise; or<\/p><p class=\"List_0020Paragraph\">&middot;     Infusing an established organization or family business with entrepreneurial vigor.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">What does this mean for you? Thinking is important--but don&rsquo;t overdo it. On the other hand, acting without thinking clearly can create too-high tuition payments that yield little learning.<\/p><p class=\"Normal\">You must figure out where your thinking should leave off and action should take over. And your ultimate goal as an entrepreneur should be to learn faster and better than your competition. That learning should help you win new customers and turning them into repeat buyers; hire the best people and make them act as an effective team; and attract the most helpful investors and learn from their insights.<\/p>","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/productivity-running-800x800_28133.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Sure, you need to spend time thinking through your decisions.

That learning should help you win new customers and turning them into repeat buyers; hire the best people and make them act as an effective team; and attract the most helpful investors and learn from their insights.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~4\/--FnSrUrsSw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>","pubDate":"Tue, 06 Aug 2013 11:00:04 -0400","dc:creator":"Peter Cohan","enclosure":{"length":"388900","type":"image\/jpeg","url":"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/productivity-running-1725x810_28133.jpg"},"guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/peter-cohan\/action-trumps-thinking.html"},"media:content":{"type":"image\/jpeg","url":"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/productivity-running-1725x810_28133.jpg","media:title":{"type":"plain","content":"When It's Time to Stop Thinking--and Start Doing"}},"feedburner:origLink":"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/peter-cohan\/action-trumps-thinking.html","y:published":{"hour":"15","timezone":"UTC","second":"4","month":"8","month_name":"August","minute":"0","utime":"1375801204","day":"6","day_ordinal_suffix":"th","day_of_week":"2","day_name":"Tuesday","year":"2013"},"y:id":{"permalink":"false","value":"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/peter-cohan\/action-trumps-thinking.html"},"y:title":"When It's Time to Stop Thinking--and Start Doing","y:repeatcount":"1"},{"title":"The Danger of Mentor\/Investor Whiplash","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~3\/2ZNwcS_d7FY\/investor-mentor-whiplash.html","description":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/stress,-brainstorming-head-in-hands-800x800_28163.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Venture capitalist Fred Wilson says you can't always listen to investors--himself included.<\/p><p>Editor's note: This article first appeared on Fred Wilson's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avc.com\/a_vc\/2013\/07\/mentorinvestor-whiplash.html\">blog<\/a>.<\/p><p>I've been doing a tour of the summer accelerator programs and a question I get a lot is about the feedback the teams get from the investors and mentors they meet with. They ask me how much should they react to the feedback they are getting advising them to do things differently, pivot, change the product, change the strategy, etc.<\/p><p>I call this constant advising\/mentoring of early stage startups \"mentor\/investor whiplash\" and I think it is a big problem. Not just with the accelerator programs but across the early stage\/seed startup landscape.<\/p><p>You cannot meet with a potential investor (me included) or mentor\/advisor without getting a lot of feedback about your business. If you take many of those meetings a week, then you are going to get pushed and pulled in lots of different directions and it will cause confusion, wasted time and energy, and even a loss of confidence in what you set out to do.<\/p><p>You cannot let that happen to you. You are the domain expert on your business. You have spent way more time and energy thinking about your business than someone who takes a 30 minute meeting with you, having never thought about it for one iota, and then gives you a ton of advice that you are doing everything wrong. You have to learn to hear that feedback but not react to it.<\/p><p>Here is what I recommend:<\/p><p>1) Create a spreadsheet and list each meeting and the feedback you got in it. List who gave it to you and what they said. If you can categorize the feedback easily, do that. A column for each category of feedback might be good. Over time you should look at the totality of the feedback and see if there are things that a large percentage of people are giving you. If that is the case, you may want to pay more attention to that.<\/p><p>2) Apply the \"investor discount\" to feedback you get from investors. Advisors\/mentors who have no agenda are a purer form of advice. Investors have their own agenda. They want to invest in \"bigger ideas\" and \"larger outcomes\". When they tell you that your idea is too small, they may be talking to themselves, not you. Do not make their problems your problems. This is your business, not theirs.<\/p><p>3) Listen to customers, users, and the market. Advisors, mentors, and investors are not the market for your product. Get your product out into the market and get feedback from real users and customers who you will serve as you grow your business. If they like what you are doing and investors do not, do more of what you are doing. The investors will come around when you are scaling into your market.<\/p><p>With those three rules in the frontal lobe of your brain, take as many meetings as you can get. Solicit feedback. Listen to it. Write it down. But do not act on it immediately. It is advice not direction. You are the boss of your company. Do what you think makes the most sense. And get your product in front of users and customers as early as possible and listen to them even more. Because the market will tell you what to do if you listen carefully enough. And Mr Market is the best advisor you can have.<\/p>","content:encoded":"<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/stress,-brainstorming-head-in-hands-800x800_28163.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Venture capitalist Fred Wilson says you can't always listen to investors--himself included.<\/p><p>Editor's note: This article first appeared on Fred Wilson's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avc.com\/a_vc\/2013\/07\/mentorinvestor-whiplash.html\">blog<\/a>.<\/p><p>I've been doing a tour of the summer accelerator programs and a question I get a lot is about the feedback the teams get from the investors and mentors they meet with.

Get started by analyzing which of these traits you might lack.<\/p><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Control is not leadership; management is not leadership; leadership is leadership.\"<br \/> --Dee Hock, founder and former CEO of Visa<\/p><\/blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Just because you're a manager, doesn't mean you're a leader. Management skills are something you you develop out of necessity; leadership skills are entirely different.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">One way to learn about the way you lead--and where you need to improve--is to look at your team. Is there a general sense of trust for each other? Do they regularly recognize each other's accomplishments? In all likelihood, what your team lacks is likely what you lack. Here are a few key traits you might be missing:<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. Empathy. This is one emotional skill that doesn't come naturally to everyone. But if you're unable to connect with others, you're probably not going to accomplish much as a leader. You need empathy to gain trust, fuel relationships, and understand reactions. If this is something you lack, try listening more to your employees (individually and in teams), tuning in to nonverbal communication, and taking a genuine interest in your colleagues.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. Recognition. Praise pays off when it comes to boosting productivity and engagement. You may feel like you're too busy to give your employees a pat on the back for every little accomplishment, but recognition serves a function: It will make employees want to continue impressing you. Consider creating a reward system that's specific to your company and using it to recognize a variety of both small and large accomplishments.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. Trust. All leader-employee relationships require trust, but it takes two to make it happen. You've got to take a few risks as a leader and your employees need to show you they can be trusted. Focus on developing this trait by regularly delegating with a no-questions-asked policy. Allow your employees to take care of the majority of the decision-making without your immediate approval.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. Sense of humor. Laughter isn't just the best medicine, it's also the secret ingredient to better leadership. Humor eases the intimidation factor that comes with managing others. It also can make bad news easier to swallow, and it's great for team building.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. Commitment. If you're struggling to motivate a team that's disengaged, it's time to take a look in the mirror. Lead by example and find new ways to prove your commitment. Instead of ducking out early to play a round of golf on your slower days, spend some time with your team and lend a helping hand when and where it's necessary.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">6. Intuition. Uncertainty and leadership often go hand in hand. When was the last time you trusted your natural intuition when making a tough decision? Instead of relying solely on others to help you make a decision, learn to find the answers within yourself. Try trusting your gut and gathering insight from past experiences.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">7. Positivity. Simply put, negativity is contagious. So if your goal is to boost employees' energy and keep them motivated, start with your own attitude.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">8. Decisiveness. Contrary to popular belief, confidently making a decision isn't a sign of dictatorship. Wavering in situations that need immediate action will lead your employees to doubt you. It's your job to know when the input of your employees is necessary and when it's your job to be the lead decision-maker.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">9. Communication. Not everyone communicates the same way, that's why it's important to have adaptable communication skills. You need to be able to describe what you want to accomplish in a way that's understood across a variety of media and by all of your employees.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">10. Respect. Do you genuinely respect your employees? If not, you may lose them. Improve the way you show it by carefully listening to their requests and needs and making the necessary sacrifices to help them, empowering them to make decisions, and treating them like humans rather than robots.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your one-of-a-kind leadership style may be missing something.
